# JAX ResNet Project

## Overview

This project implements a Residual Network (ResNet) model from scratch using JAX, a high-performance machine learning framework. The purpose is to build, understand, and debug the ResNet architecture using JAXâ€™s functional programming and automatic differentiation features.

---

## Project Structure

- **model/**: Contains the ResNet model architecture and building blocks (residual blocks, skip connections, bottlenecks, etc.).
- **data/**: Scripts and utilities for data loading, preprocessing, and augmentation.
- **train/**: Training loop, optimizer setup (e.g., Adam), loss functions, and evaluation scripts.
- **utils/**: Helper functions, configuration parsers, and common utilities.
- **lib/**: (Not tracked in Git) External libraries or environment-dependent binaries.  
  *Note:* This directory is excluded from the repository using `.gitignore` to keep the repo clean.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- JAX (with CPU/GPU support as needed)
- Other dependencies as listed in `requirements.txt`

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git
    cd your-repo
    ```

2. (Optional) Create a virtual environment and activate it:
    ```
    python -m venv env
    source env/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac
    env\Scripts\activate     # Windows
    ```

3. Install dependencies:

 pip install -r requirements.txt
    
## Usage

### Training the ResNet model

Run the training script:
```
python train/train_resnet.py --config configs/train_config.yaml
```

### Evaluating the model

Run evaluation:
python train/evaluate.py --checkpoint path/to/model_checkpoint



## Git Best Practices for this Project

- Keep the `lib/` directory untracked by Git. See `.gitignore` for reference.
- Use the following commands to initialize/upload your project:

```
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git
git push -u origin main
```
